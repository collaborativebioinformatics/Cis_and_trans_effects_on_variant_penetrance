# Local Ancestry StructLMM for GxG Interactions

## Overview

This repository contains a methodology that adapts the StructLMM framework to study Gene-Gene (GxG) interactions instead of Gene-Environment (GxE) interactions. Our approach leverages local ancestry Principal Components (PCs) as a proxy for the "environment" in the StructLMM model.

## Methodology

We extend the StructLMM framework by Moore et al. (2018) to detect GxG interactions using the following inputs:

1. A query SNV that has a large effect size for a phenotype
2. A query region of interest to test for interactions (can be cis or trans)
3. The phenotype

The key innovation is using local ancestry Principal Components as the "environment" matrix in the StructLMM model. This allows us to capture interaction effects between the query SNV and genetic variants in the region of interest.

### Model

The adapted model is structured as:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{M}\boldsymbol{\alpha} + g\boldsymbol{\beta_0} + g\circ\boldsymbol{\beta_1} + \mathbf{e} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon},$$

where:

$$\boldsymbol{\beta_0} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, r_0 \cdot \rho\mathbf{I}), \quad \boldsymbol{\beta_1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, r_0(1-\rho)\mathbf{EE}^\top), \quad \mathbf{e} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, r_1\mathbf{EE}^\top), \quad \text{and} \quad \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, r_2\mathbf{I}).$$

- **y** is the phenotype vector
- **M** contains covariates
- **g** is the query SNV with large effect size
- **E** is a matrix representing local ancestry PCs from the query region
- $\rho \in [0, 1]$ dictates the relevance of the interaction effect

## Pipeline

We are assuming that the genotypes are in PLINK format split by chromosome and reside in a directory here called "testPlink", click to [download](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSST936), and make sure it's in the testPlink folder

### Step 1: Extract Local Ancestry PCs

We extract Principal Components from a specified genomic region to capture local ancestry patterns:

```bash
./dataPrepScripts/getPCfromPlinkDirectory.sh testPlink/  chr6:29944513-29945558 output/PCoutput
```

The script:
1. Extracts variants from the region of interest
2. Performs quality control
3. Calculates PCs that explain up to 90% of variance
4. Outputs PC coordinates and variance explained

Optionally, you can extract the single variant of interest:

```bash
./dataPrepScripts/getSingleVariantFromPlinkDirectory.sh testPlink/ chr6:32529369:C:A output/SNVoutput.txt
```

The query variant can be from any source and can even be an aggregate score over multiple variants.

### Step 2: Run StructLMM with Local Ancestry PCs

We then apply the StructLMM framework using:
- The query SNV as the genetic variant
- Local ancestry PCs as the "environment"
- The phenotype of interest

## Requirements

- PLINK 2.0
- Python 3.6+
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - [StructLMM](https://github.com/limix/struct-lmm)

## Usage


### Step 1: Extract local ancestry PCs
```bash
# Extract PCs from region of interest
./dataPrepScripts/getPCfromPlinkDirectory.sh testPlink/  chr6:29944513-29945558 output/PCoutput

# Optional: Extract the variant of interest
./dataPrepScripts/getSingleVariantFromPlinkDirectory.sh testPlink/ chr6:32529369:C:A output/SNVoutput.txt
```

### Step 2: Run GxG analysis
```bash
python gxg-structlmm-script.py \
  --pcs output/PCoutput_local_ancestry_pcs.csv \
  --snv output/SNVoutput.txt  \
  --phenotype testPlink/synthetic_small_v1.pheno1 \
  --phenotype-column "Phenotype(binary)" \
  --output results.csv
```
